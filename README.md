## üí° Idea for the app

After playing the game BSS for a couple of months, I searched for an app which would make life easier when crafting items within the game. Unfortunately, nothing existed like I wanted so I decided to just create it myself.

Initially it started off with just a recipe calculator for items, but after deploying the app and sending it out to the community for feedback I recieved a lot of requests to add more features such as a hive planner (plan out items for the future) as well as an exp and money calculator to see how much it would cost to level up items.

It was a fun project start to finish and using a lot of new tech such as the React beautiful dnd npm package to allow me to drag items without needing to create the functionality myself, it was hard initally but after delving into the docs and getting used to the syntax's used I'm comfortable using it and will implement it in other projects.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Future Plans

In the future I would like to revisit and add some of my initial goals including:

- Item cheatsheet which shows all stats and method for making items stronger.

- Get feedback from the community and add any features requested.
